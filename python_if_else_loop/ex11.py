#Print all prime numbers within a range
#Note: A Prime Number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

#A Prime Number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.
#
#Examples:
#
#6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
#37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.
